# What is it?
It is a small utility to convert .BIN snapshots ([BK-0010(01)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronika_BK) emulator format) into sound WAV files which can be played and recognized by real BK-0010 TAP reader.   
The Project is based on [old QBasic based converter project](http://bk-mg.narod.ru/).

# Description in Russian
Утилита для конвертации BIN файлов (снапшотов для эмуляторов БК-0010 и БК-0010-01) в аудио WAV формат. Позволяет получать файлы с обычной скоростью загрузки и турбированные, пригодные к загрузке на БК-0010 через магнитофонный вход.

# What is BK-0010
[The BK-0010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronika_BK) was the most popular Soviet 16-bit home computer platform of the 1980s and was also my first computer (which still works).

# Pre-built binaries?
Pre-compiled versions of the utility are available for download on [the latest release page](https://github.com/raydac/bkbin2wav/releases/latest).

# How to use it?

Initially, the converter was written in [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), but I later developed a GoLang version. The Python version requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) to be installed, whereas the pre-compiled GoLang version can be used as a standalone executable without any additional setup.

The utility has a command-line interface and can be executed with the following configurations:

## Example for native version
```
bkbin2wav-windows386.exe -i Arkanoid.bin -o Arkanoid.wav
```
## Example for python version
```
python bkbin2wav.py -i Arkanoid.bin -o Arkanoid.wav
```
## Start without arguments
If you start the application without parameters, it will display a list of available options.
```
bkbin2wav -i <binfile> [-a] [-o <wavfile>] [-n <name>] [-s addr] [-t]

    Command line options:
        -h          Print help
        -f          Use file size instead of .BIN header size field value
        -a          Amplify the audio signal in the result WAV file
        -i <file>   The BIN file to be converted
        -o <file>   The Result WAV file (by default the BIN file name with WAV extension)
        -n <name>   The Name of the file in the TAP header (must be less or equals 16 chars)
        -s <addr>   The Start address for the TAP header (by default the start address from the BIN will be used)
        -t          Use the double frequency "turbo" mode
```
Sometimes, .BIN files may contain an incorrect data size value in their header. In such cases, you can use the __-f__ flag to enforce the use of the physical file length instead of the data length defined in the BIN header.
